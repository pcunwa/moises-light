This is an unofficial PyTorch implementation of the Moises-Light architecture from ["Moises-Light: Resource-efficient Band-split U-Net for Music Source Separation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06785) (Hung et al., WASPAA 2025). The paper does not release code; this is an independent implementation based on the paper's description and the open-source implementations of [DTTNet](https://github.com/JacobChen258/DTTNet-Unofficial), [BS-RoFormer](https://github.com/lucidrains/BS-RoFormer), and [SCNet](https://github.com/starrytong/SCNet).

- [rotary-embedding-torch](https://github.com/lucidrains/rotary-embedding-torch)

## Quick Start

```python
import torch
from moises_light import MoisesLight, configs

# Use a preset
model = MoisesLight(**configs['paper_large'])

# Forward pass
x = torch.randn(1, 2, 264600)  # [batch, channels, samples] 6s @ 44.1kHz
y = model(x)                   # [1, 4, 2, 264600] = [batch, stems, channels, samples]

# With auxiliary outputs interface (for training framework compatibility)
y, aux = model(x, return_auxiliary_outputs=True)
```

## Preset Configurations

All presets use `n_fft=6144`, `hop_size=1024`, stereo input, and 4-stem output (vocals, drums, bass, other).

The paper truncates the STFT at 2048 bins (~14.7 kHz), zeroing everything above. While the original [DTTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08684) paper noted that this truncation has little to no effect on SI-SDR scores, in practice these high frequencies are critical for perceptual audio quality — vocal air, cymbal shimmer, synth brightness, etc. all live above 15 kHz. This package includes fullband presets that extend processing to the full 0-22 kHz spectrum.

Extending to fullband requires increasing `n_bands` from 4 to 6 (to maintain 512 bins per band), and **G must be divisible by `n_bands`** for group convolutions. Since 56 is not divisible by 6, G must change. Two strategies are provided:

1. **Fullband matched-param** — Pick the nearest valid G that keeps total params similar to the paper (G=60 or 36). This trades per-band capacity for full spectrum coverage within the same parameter budget. SI-SDR may decrease slightly since the same capacity is spread across 2 additional high-frequency bands.
2. **Fullband wide** — Pick G so that `G/n_bands` matches the paper's per-group channel count (84/6=14, matching 56/4=14). Each band retains the same representation power as the paper model, but total params increase ~1.8x. This may preserve metric performance while gaining full spectrum coverage.

### Paper-Faithful (truncated spectrum, 0-14.7 kHz)

Faithful to the paper's architecture. Frequencies above ~14.7 kHz are zeroed.

| Preset        | G   | Bands | Per-group ch | Freq coverage | Params    |
| ------------- | --- | ----- | ------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| `paper_large` | 56  | 4     | 14           | 0-14.7 kHz    | 4,660,592 |
| `paper_small` | 32  | 4     | 8            | 0-14.7 kHz    | 2,520,592 |

### Fullband Matched-Param (full spectrum, 0-22 kHz, similar param budget)

Full spectrum via 6 bands of 512 bins (`freq_dim=3072`). G adjusted to keep param count close to paper variants.

| Preset           | G   | Bands | Per-group ch | Freq coverage | Params    |
| ---------------- | --- | ----- | ------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| `fullband_large` | 60  | 6     | 10           | 0-22 kHz      | 4,948,612 |
| `fullband_small` | 36  | 6     | 6            | 0-22 kHz      | 2,824,244 |

### Fullband Wide (full spectrum, 0-22 kHz, matched per-group capacity)

Full spectrum with the same per-group channel capacity as the paper models.

| Preset                | G   | Bands | Per-group ch | Freq coverage | Params    |
| --------------------- | --- | ----- | ------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| `fullband_large_wide` | 84  | 6     | 14           | 0-22 kHz      | 8,354,908 |
| `fullband_small_wide` | 48  | 6     | 8            | 0-22 kHz      | 4,102,712 |

## Architecture

![Moises-Light Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crlandsc/moises-light/main/images/moises_light_architecture.png)

Moises-Light builds on the [DTTNet](https://github.com/JacobChen258/DTTNet-Unofficial) foundation (a symmetric U-Net with TFC-TDF encoder/decoder blocks and dual-path RNN bottleneck) and integrates improvements from [BS-RoFormer](https://github.com/lucidrains/BS-RoFormer) and [SCNet](https://github.com/starrytong/SCNet):

- **Band splitting via group convolutions** (inspired by [BSRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15174)/[BS-RoFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02612)): Instead of [DTTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08684)'s full-spectrum convolutions, the STFT is divided into `n_bands` equal-width subbands and processed with group convolutions (`Split Module`). This replaces [DTTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08684)'s first/last 1x1 convolutions and dramatically reduces parameters compared to the original band-split MLPs in [BSRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15174).
- **Split and Merge Module** (replaces [DTTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08684)'s TFC-TDF V3 blocks): Group conv blocks with `n_bands` groups replace the original TFC layers, so each band is processed independently. The TDF (Time-Distributed Frequency FC) bottleneck is retained but now operates on per-band frequency dimensions (`freq_dim / n_bands`), which is `n_bands` times cheaper.
- **RoPE transformer bottleneck** (from [BS-RoFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02612)): [DTTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08684)'s dual-path RNN is replaced with dual-path RoPE transformers for sequence modeling along both frequency and time axes. This improves performance without significantly increasing parameters.
- **Asymmetric encoder/decoder** (from [SCNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13276)): The encoder has `n_enc` heavy stages (each with a full Split and Merge block), while the decoder uses only `n_dec` heavy stages plus `n_enc - n_dec` light stages (upsample + skip connection only, no Split and Merge). This saves significant compute in the decoder.
- **Frequency truncation** (from [DTTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08684)): Only `freq_dim` of the `n_fft/2+1` STFT bins are processed; the rest are zero-padded for iSTFT reconstruction. Paper presets truncate at ~14.7 kHz; fullband presets extend to ~22 kHz.
- **Multiplicative skip connections** (from [DTTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08684)): Decoder stages combine upsampled features with encoder skip connections via element-wise multiplication rather than concatenation or addition.

## Implementation Notes

This is an independent implementation — the paper does not release code. The following decisions were made where the paper was ambiguous or where I diverged:

- **Asymmetric decoder interpretation**: The paper specifies `N_enc=3, N_dec=1` (Table 1) but doesn't explicitly state what happens with the remaining 2 decoder stages. I interpret `N_dec=1` as 1 heavy stage (with Split and Merge processing) and 2 light stages (upsample + skip connection only), matching the SCNet asymmetric pattern.

- **Time-only downsampling**: [DTTNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08684) downsamples both time and frequency dimensions (`T/2^N` and `F/2^N`). Our implementation only downsamples time. The paper states that band-splitting "allows us to remove frequency pooling or upsampling across all DTTNet layers" (Sec 3.1), but doesn't explicitly confirm this removal in the final architecture.

- **Transformer hyperparameters**: The paper does not specify the RoPE transformer's internal dimensions. I use `heads=4, dim_head=32, ff_mult=2` — chosen to keep the bottleneck lightweight and consistent with the model's parameter budget.

- **Multiplicative masking**: The paper states the model "directly generating the separated target spectrogram." By default (`use_mask=True`), our implementation applies multiplicative masking on the original STFT (i.e., the network predicts a mask rather than the spectrogram directly). This is a common and effective approach in other SOTA models like [BS-RoFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02612) and often leads to better perceptual quality, particularly for silent segments. Setting `use_mask=False` switches to the paper's direct spectrogram generation mode, where the network output produces spectrograms directly.

- **Z-score normalization**: The paper does not mention input normalization. I apply Z-score normalization (zero mean, unit variance) to the STFT features before the U-Net, inspired by [HTDemucs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08553)-style preprocessing. This is standard practice in similar architectures and stabilizes training.

- **Multi-stem output**: The paper trains separate per-stem models (4x ~5M params for VDBO). This implementation outputs all stems simultaneously via a shared encoder and source head, as this paradigm has proven effective in other U-Net models like [HTDemucs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08553) and [SCNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13276). To reproduce the paper's approach, train 4 separate single-stem models (e.g., `MoisesLight(sources=['vocals'])`).

## Integration

### Custom Training Loop

```python
model = MoisesLight(**configs['paper_large'])
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-4)

for batch in dataloader:
    mix = batch['mix']          # [B, 2, L]
    targets = batch['targets']  # [B, 4, 2, L]
    pred = model(mix)           # [B, 4, 2, L]
    loss = criterion(pred, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

## Known Limitations

- **MPS (Apple Silicon)**: `torch.istft` does not support MPS. The model automatically falls back to CPU for iSTFT, which adds overhead. This is a PyTorch limitation, not a model issue.
- **Frequency truncation**: Paper presets zero frequencies above ~14.7 kHz. Use fullband presets if high-frequency content matters.
